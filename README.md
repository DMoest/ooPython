# ooPython

This repository is my work in the course ooPython at Blekinge Institute of Technologies.
Lectures are held by the [dbwebb team](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/oopython-v2) at BTH.

Here we go through lectures with examples followed by weekly [assignments](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/oopython-v2#kursmoment) and a [final exam](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/oopython-v2/kmom10). 
Assignments in this course are part by part taking steps to build a Flask application for a [Yatzy game](https://gamerules.com/rules/yahtzee-dice-game/). 

The folder ```/flask``` holds the Flask application. Examples and assignments are spread out over the folders ```kmom 01 - 06```.
